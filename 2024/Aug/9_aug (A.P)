Today i study sequence and series , what in sequence nd series , that day i learn a.p.(arithmatic prograssion).

SO lets explore waht squence and series.

by adding or substrating nth term of a sequence we get series.
a1 + a2 + a3 .... an is a series.
a1, a2 , a3 ... is a sequence.

Airthmatic prograssion(A.P)

1.Nth term
an = a+(n-1)d             #where a is a first term , and d is a common difference (a2-a1) and n is the term , which is in an.

2.Sum of the Nth term
Sn = n/2(a+(n-1)d)

3.If last term is givien then
Sn = n/2(a+l)             #where l is last term , so as my thought l = (n-1)d

///////////////////////////////////////////
////Some short tricks and impornent too////
///////////////////////////////////////////

1. If pth term of an ap is q and qth term of an ap is p then mth term is
p+q-m                     #where d = -1 and a = p+q and (p+q)th = 0

2. If pth term of an ap is 1/q and qth term of an ap is 1/p them mth term is
am = m/pq                 #where a and d = 1/pq
Sm = m(m+q)/2pq  

3. If ratio of the sum of the nth term is f(n):g(n) then the ratio of their nth term will be
f(2n-1):g(2n-1)           #we just put n = 2n-1 in (f(n):g(n))

4. If ratio of the Nth term is f(n):g(n) and the ratio of the sum of the term will be:
f(n+1/2):g(n+1/2)         #We just put n = n+1/2 in .......

/////////////
///Remarks///
/////////////

1. The first term and common differnce of an ap can be zero or +tive or -tive (nor complex number).
2. IF a+b+c in an ap then 2b = a+c  
if a+b+c+d then  a+d = b+c

3. Selection of terms
The Third term of an ap is a-d,a,a+d
The foruth term of an ap is a-3d,a-d,a+d,a+3d
as same as the fifth term of an ap is a-2d,a-d,a,a+d,a+3d
the sixth term = a-5d,a-3d,a-d,a,a+d,a+3d+a+5d        #Here you ca see a parrten how its happens. -1d in even and -3d in odd.

///////////////////////////
///Arithmetic mean (A.M)///           /* We also say that as name of average */
///////////////////////////

1. a A b is an ap            #Where A is A.M  amd a is first term and b is last term
2. A.M of a A b = a+b/2
3. A.M of a1,a2,a3,a4...an = a1+a2+a3+...+an

Intertion of 'n' A.M b/w a and b.

1. iF a  A1,A2,A3,...,An  b  is an ap then
First term = a
last term = Tn+2 = b
a+(n-1)d = b => a + (n+2-1)D = b  =>             #Where n = n+2 because of Tn+2 is lasst term which is given
D = b-a/n+1        Where D is the Commom differnce.

So, 
A1 = a+d
A2 = a+2d
A3 = a+3d 
...
An = a+nd

My revison is complete also it can be help to improve my typing speed as well as good for mental traning.
